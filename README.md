# Charity NFT Collection

## 1. Project Title
**Charity NFT Collection â€“ Mint NFTs for a Cause**

## 2. Project Description
This is a simple Clarity smart contract that allows users to:
1. **Mint NFTs** as part of a charity art collection.
2. **Donate STX tokens** directly to the contract to support charitable causes.

Every NFT minted is tied to a unique ID and can include a metadata URI for the artwork. All STX donations are recorded, ensuring transparency and traceability.

Our vision is to create a decentralized platform where artists and supporters can come together to fund meaningful social causes through NFT art collections. By using blockchain technology, we ensure:
- Transparent donation records.
- Immutable NFT ownership.
- A trustworthy charity funding mechanism.

## 4. Future Scope
- Integration with a **charity DAO** to govern fund usage.
- Automated STX fund distribution to verified charity wallets.
- Support for **multiple NFT collections** with categories for different causes.
- NFT resale royalty system that directs a percentage of resale value to the charity.
- Front-end interface for easier minting and donation tracking.
